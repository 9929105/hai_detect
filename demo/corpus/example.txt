We examined the patient yesterday. He shows signs of pneumonia.
The wound is CDI. He has not developed a urinary tract infection. However, there is a wound infection near the abdomen.
He has a history of surgical site infections. There were complications due to pneumonia that was likely present at the time of surgery. 3 drains in place with serosanguinous output. I had to open the wound.
There is a surgical site infection. There is an abscess. The benefits and risks of surgery were discussed with the patient, including pain, bleeding, infection, abscess formation.
